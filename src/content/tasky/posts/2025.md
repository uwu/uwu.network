2025 went by without much fanfare. It wasn't anything crazy, just a normal year.

To start, I picked up new languages and refreshed some old skills this year, and it felt good to solidify things I'd learned before but never quite mastered.

Life was hectic in its own way. I played a lot of video games, listened to music, made new friends, and went outside for activities. I was a bit less active online this year, especially after a falling out with fmhy. It was a change, but it gave me more time for other things, and honestly, that turned out okay.

I released Wotaku 2, a redesign of [wotaku.wiki](https://wotaku.wiki) (which you should checkout!), and earlier this year I remade my own website and added a micro section for short notes, thoughts, opinions, and announcements. It's been nice having a place for the smaller things that don't quite fit in a full blog post.

I really enjoyed Advent of Code this year. We got 14 days of puzzles instead of the whole month of December, which was plenty of time for me to solve them. I was able to come up with all the solutions, and a lot of them needed very specific, carefully thought-out approaches. There's something really satisfying about cracking those puzzles.

I'm currently working on [flora](https://github.com/uwu/flora), a Discord bot runtime that lets server admins write TypeScript code for their servers. It's built with Deno's v8, deno_core, and the oxc toolchain for parsing and transpilation.

Soon, I should start talking about my activites on this space, which I already know, definitely ain't happening fam.

2026? I'm thinking it'll be a similar year, probably. Same shit as always. Always.
