seems that it's rather difficult for me to do something i have absolutely no
interest in\n
we had "citizenship day" at school where we basically get some assignments with
regards to currently ongoing events (like those stupid climate activists)\n
but like, seriously, things that go on these days bothers me so little that
doing assignments about them feels incredibly unproductive to me, like what's
the point, it's not like i'm learning anything\n
but well, i got to go home earlier and am off for the rest of the week, so why
would i care lol
