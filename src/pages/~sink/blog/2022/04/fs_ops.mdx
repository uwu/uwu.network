# How F# ops work

F# is full of funky functional operators. Here's how they all work!

Note: this page uses Jetbrains Mono, which includes ligatures.
This means that some unusual operators may be ligagurised in an
unfamiliar way to some.

<LigatureComparer ops="|> ||> |||> <| <|| <||| <>" />

## Pipeline

The pipe operator takes a value on the left and passes it through
the function on the right. The function can be partially applied
due to F# currying and still work.
```fsharp
// declaration
let inline (|>) arg func = func arg
// usage
5 |> printfn "%i"
// equivalent
printfn "%i" 5
```

There is also a double pipe that takes a tuple of two args on the left.
```fsharp
// declaration
let inline (||>) (arg1, arg2) func = func arg1 arg2
// usage
(5, 6) ||> printfn "%i %i"
// equivalent
printfn "%i %i" 5 6
```

And a triple:
```fsharp
// declaration
let inline (|||>) (arg1, arg2, arg3) func = func arg1 arg2 arg3
// usage
(5, 6, 7) |||> printfn "%i %i"
// equivalent
printfn "%i %i %i" 5 6 7
```

I guess its worth mentioning the reverse pipes, which serve little
purpose other than to help with keeping parenthesis use down.
```fsharp
printfn "%i"       <|   5
printfn "%i %i"    <||  (5, 6)
printfn "%i %i %i" <||| (5, 6, 7)
```

## Composition

Composition is one of the most key functional concepts.
You will come across it in the mathematical definition of functions,
not just in function programming languages.
It is the joining of two functions together to build a new one.

It can actually be defined in terms of pipes, if youre so inclined:
```fsharp
let inline (>>) func1 func2 x = x |> func1 |> func2
```

But here is the definition in the actual F# stdlib.
```fsharp
// delcaration
let inline (>>) func1 func2 x = func2 (func1 x)
// usage
let add1ThenDouble = add1 >> double
(add1ThenDouble 5) = 12
// equivalent
let add1ThenDouble x = x |> add1 |> double
(add1ThenDouble 5) = 12
```

There is also a reverse composition operator `<<` if thats your jam.
```fsharp
let add1ThenDouble = double << add1
```

## List concat operator

List cons is not an operator, so will not be detailed here,
but the list concatenation operator is.

It combines two singly linked lists together, thus this one
is more complex, and involves recursion.
For this reason it is also not inlined in F#.

```fsharp
let rec (@) list1 list2 =
  match list1 with
  | [] -> list2
  | head::tail -> head::(tail @ list2)
```

This is a very inefficient version of the code, which does not
make use of tail recursion (the F# stdlib version actually uses
mutation to make it as fast as it can possibly be), however it does
provide a usable mental model of how it could work.

Specifically, in continually removing the first element off list1,
then placing all of them back on the front of list2.

Here's a usage:
```fsharp
// usage
[1; 2; 3] @ [4; 5; 6]
// equivalent
1::(2::(3::[4; 5; 6]))
// or just
[1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]
```

## Type casting operators
There are two type casting operators in F#: The upcast and downcast.

### Upcast operator

The upcast operator casts a type to one of its base types.
This is compile time checked, and if it compiles it will
*ALWAYS* work at runtime.

```fsharp
// this is actually handled by the compiler
// so no declaration here
// usage
type MyType = { foo: string }
let myVal = { foo = "bar" }
myVal :> obj // now a System.Object. Guaranteed to work.
```

### Downcast operator

The downcast operator casts a type to an inherited type.
This may not be compile time verified and is viable to fail at
runtime, throwing an `InvalidCastException`.

```fsharp
// see above
// usage
type MyType = { foo: string }
let myVal: obj = { foo = "bar" }
// myVal is an object of unknown type now
myVal :?> MyType // { foo: "bar" }
```

### Extra: safe downcasting
```fsharp
type MyType = { foo: string }

let toMyTypeOrDefault (maybeMyType: obj) =
  match maybeMyType with
  | :? MyType as mt -> mt
  | _ -> { foo = "bar" }

{ foo = "test" } :> obj |> toMyTypeOrDefault // { foo: "test" }
"this is totally valid" |> toMyTypeOrDefault // { foo: "bar" }
```

## Other fun things you may not be used to
The following operators are equivalent (F# first, C# second)
```fsharp
=  // (in comparisons!)
<>
-> // (anonymous functions with the fun keyword)
<- // assigning to a mutable variable
(* comment *)
[<Attribute>]
&&& // bitwise and
<<< // shift left
>>> // shift right
^^^ // bitwise xor
||| // bitwise or
~~~ // bitwise not
```
```csharp
==
!=
=>
=
/* comment */
[Attribute]
&  // bitwise and
<< // shift left
>> // shift right
^  // bitwise xor
|  // bitwise or
~  // bitwise not
```

F# lists are constructed out of heads (the first element)
and tails (the rest of the list) - these are singly linked lists.
This is done with the cons operator:
```fsharp
let list = [2; 3; 4]
let fullList = 1::list
fullList = [1; 2; 3; 4]
```

## Final note

If you're still here, give F# a go.

It's got some funky operators and things, sure,
but its got a beautiful heart and you will never want to go back.
