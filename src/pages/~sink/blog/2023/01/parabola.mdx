# Proving the parabola of connected intervals

## The exercise

There's a very good chance you've done this activity before: take a worksheet like the one below,
and connect equally spaced intervals with lines.

This, as you decrease the interval size, starts to resemble a curve, but which curve?

## My motivation

Why am I here doing this?

Well, the other day my math teacher (in a math/coding activity thing the college run)
was showing off this as a coding exercise, using [p5js](https://p5js.org) to make the
computer draw this.

From there he asked what this curve might be, and we then spent a long chunk of time
attempting to prove that it was a parabola.

I wanted to complete, tidy up, and present that proof, so here I am!

## Let's define the actual damn curve first

It's all fun and games to construct approximations of curve out of lines,
but we do need to actually have an idea of what the curve *is*.
