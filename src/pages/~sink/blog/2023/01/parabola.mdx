# Proving the parabola of connected intervals

## The exercise

There's a very good chance you've done this activity before: take a worksheet like the one below,
and connect equally spaced intervals with lines.

This, as you decrease the interval size, starts to resemble a curve, but which curve?

## My motivation

Why am I here doing this?

Well, the other day my math teacher (in a math/coding activity thing the college run)
was showing off this as a coding exercise, using [p5js](https://p5js.org) to make the
computer draw this.

From there he asked what this curve might be, and we then spent a long chunk of time
attempting to prove that it was a parabola.

I wanted to complete, tidy up, and present that proof, so here I am!

## Let's define the actual damn curve first

It's all fun and games to construct approximations of curve out of lines,
but we do need to actually have an idea of what the curve *is*.

<div class="flex flex-wrap">
  <img src="/sink/quiet_parabola/approx_6.svg" />
  <img src="/sink/quiet_parabola/approx_20.svg" />
  <img src="/sink/quiet_parabola/approx_100.svg" />
</div>

So an important thing to notice here is that, if we take any of these ones lines
(see the one in red!), the point on that line that we want to actually be a part of our curve
is tangent to said curve.

Lets modify our construction just slightly so that we are constructing on diagonal lines,
so each line will connect the points `(k, k)` and `(k-n, n-k)` for real `k` and constant `n`.

What we actually need to do is to make this graph dense and split the area into
"places where there are points" and "places where there are no points".

The boundary of these two areas is our curve.
