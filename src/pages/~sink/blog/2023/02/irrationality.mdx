# Prove that <K>\sqrt p</K> is irrational for all prime <K>p</K>

Woah! What the hell happened to me, I'm all *serif* and *academic* ! ... huh.

Well anyway, today I thought it'd be fun to share this little proof,
plus try to pull off the TeX look just for the hell of it! :p

I'm going to slow this off using proof by contradiction, by the way.

## *Proof*
Assume that <K>\sqrt p</K> is rational - that is <K>\sqrt p = \frac a b</K>,
where <K>a</K> and <K>b</K> are coprime integers.

<div class="ml-6">
  *Author's note:* coprime means that they do not share any common factors.

  It is a sensible part of the definition of rational, as it enforces that rational numbers
  should be given in their simplest form, which should be simple-ish to do for all true
  rational numbers.

  No rational number must *necessarily* have coprime numerator and denominator.
</div>

<K D>p=\frac\{a^2}\{b^2}</K>
<K D>p b^2=a^2</K>

### If <K>a</K> divides by <K>p</K>:

<K>a</K> is of the form <K>kp, k\in\mathbb Z</K>

<K D>a^2=(kp)^2=k^2 p^2</K>
<K D>pb^2=k^2 p^2</K>
<K D>b^2=k^2 p</K>

For this to be true, <K>b^2</K> must divide by <K>p</K>, <K>\therefore b</K> must divide by <K>p</K>.

This would mean that <K>a</K>, <K>b</K> share factor <K>p</K>, so are not coprime! ↯

### If <K>a</K> does not divide by <K>p</K>:

<K>a</K> is of the form <K>kp+n, k\in\mathbb Z, n</K> does not divide by <K>p</K>.

<K D>pb^2 = (kp+n)^2 = k^2 p^2 + 2nkp + n^2</K>
<K D>b^2 = k^2 p + 2nk + \frac\{n^2} p</K>

<K>n</K> does not divide by <K>p \therefore n^2</K> does not divide by <K>p</K>.

<K>\therefore \frac\{n^2} p</K> is not an integer, <K>\therefore b^2</K> is not an integer,
<K>\therefore b</K> is not an integer!  ↯

### Conclusion
<K>a</K> cannot divide by <K>p</K>, but also cannot *not* divide by <K>p</K>.

This is impossible, so <K>\sqrt p</K> cannot be rational!

<K>\therefore \sqrt p</K> is irrational for all prime <K>p</K> <K>\square</K>

</div>

So, uh, back to normal!

That was a proof that I managed to find earlier after a lot of playing,
and I was very pleasantly surprised with how the second half pretty much just
fell into place once I had the first half sorted.

This was very fun to think about and devise, hopefully its not too dense
/ different to what people were maybe expecting me to post about!

Seems I'm drifting from tech and stuff towards math...

Anywho, hope to cya back here soon!
