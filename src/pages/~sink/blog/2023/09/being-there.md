# I'm here. I can also not be.

It's pretty nice to be there for people you care about.
It's pretty nice to have people you care about be there for you.

But here's the thing, have you ever brought something up offhand and had someone explode into "you can talk to me"
etc etc?

Sometimes it can feel pressuring.

I think it's pretty important to make it clear that if someone wants to tell you to fuck off,
or that they think you're not the person to talk to, or anything else, that's okay.

Does this sound preachy? Maybe so, but I've noticed this from both ends.
It's always meant well, but it can feel pressuring.

Treading lightly is really hard though, I know I'm guilty of it myself.

Food for thought.
