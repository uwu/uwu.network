# A not-retrospective: 2023

It's insane that it's that time again. Wow. I'm a lil early at the 9th but who's counting?
[Last year I posted this](../../2022/12/look-back) on the 31st December, in fact it's been 343 days since then as I write this.
It feels like 2 months.

Well, last year I broke down a load of events that happened and a load of projects I worked on.
Very neat, very efficient. That is such a 2022-me thing to do, aw look, cute lil thing... hey you over there,
put down your laptop, get out your notebook and open a textbook, mkay? Oh well. He got stuff done at least!

This year, I'm doing this differently, I'm not doing that. I don't want to do that.
There's only two ways that road can lead.

Road one is not fun for anyone, and far more personal than I want this blog to be.
Road two is the average Instagram account, in which everything would just feel so fake that it wouldn't be *me*.

So here's all I'll say.
This has been the worst year of my life.
I'm trying, I'm trying my best. If that means anything.

I'm alive, I'm here, I've got the next 4 years of my life loosely planned out for me.
I somehow managed to find a relationship, lord knows how. I'll find myself.

Maybe your 2023 went great, I'm glad.
Maybe your 2023 sucked, but hey, here's to the dream of a killer 2024.

Be kind to yourselves. You all deserve it. Take a break. Love people. I love you all. Thanks for being here. And be kind to yourselves, again.

 -- sink.
