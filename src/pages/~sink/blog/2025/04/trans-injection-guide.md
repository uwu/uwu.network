# Hazel's Trans Injection Guide

As many trans individuals in the world do, I take my HRT as a subcutaneous injection. I was disappointed not to find many great resources on how exactly one goes about doing this when I was starting, and now that I've been doing this for a while, I want to share both my process and some advice on the topic.

A quick word on what this is not: I will not be giving advice on which kind of HRT you should be taking or what dosage you should be aiming for - while I could give that kind of advice that would be much more individual and very much out of scope for this! I'm just gonna show you how I would recommend performing a subcutaneous injection in general. Please see https://diyhrt.wiki for a overall primer and help with all things HRT, https://hrtcafe.net to find trusted vendors (and updates on vendors!) and further information on particular medications, dosing, extra health concerns (e.g. liver function tests for bica), and so on.

I plan to make a video version of this guide to better visually demonstrate the method, and show you what a HRT injection looks like following this guide, but no promises here, I'll update if I do.

I'll link it here if and when I make that, but until then the best guide I'm aware of, and the resource that got me started was Jerrica Kirkleigh's video for Plume, here: [Subcutaneous injection tutorial for trans people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmlFCss-hkQ) and here: [Intramuscular injection tutorial for trans people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-Zd7c-qySM). I diverge from this method in some places but its a well produced guide that I think is great for *just watching someone perform an injection*, as well as a starting point.

</div>

Even if you prefer to follow these video's method, because they are clearly far more professional than this blog post, I still would ask you to read my advice section at the end of this page, as there are things I know now that I wish I knew when I was following these!

In addition, while my tutorial does *not* cover the injection method for an intramuscular injection, I still believe my preparation to be a better method. I defer to the video linked for the IM method as I have never injected intramuscularly.

## Three Injection PSAs

Yes, the PSAs are boring / a chore to read, but if I'm going to be telling and showing you how to do an injection, I need you to be doing it safely, and *you* need you to be doing it safely. Please read this carefully and do your best to stay safe out there. It's worth the time. Also keep a level head, if you get a little more soreness than usual or a little bit more blood than usual its not the end of the world for a subcutaneous injection, try not to freak out, you'll be okay and it'd hurt your confidence for next time around.

One: you are injecting a substance into your body. As such, preventing infection is very important, and we do this by being sterile.

- You must not forget to use alcohol swabs on the vial and injection site to sterilise them before use.

- You must use new/fresh needles and syringes each time. This ensures that there is no debris inside the syringe left over from last time, and you have a clean blank sterile slate to go from. If you REALLY have to reuse a syringe for some reason, you can find instructions on syringe cleaning [here](https://cloudfront.exchangesupplies.org/pdfs/F722_LDS.pdf). *Never* reuse a needle. They are one-use-only.

  - If you are considering cleaning reusing a syringe due to inability to afford injection equipment, I would urge you to *first* consider using a single-needle injection technique in which you use an injection-suitable needle to draw and then inject without a needle swap. This is a much lesser risk than reusing syringes, and I explain how to adapt this method for a single needle in the advice section at the end.

- You should keep the cap on the needle whenever possible, for general safety (it's sharp!) and to protect it, but also to prevent it from getting contaminated by contact with anything that isnt the inside of the cap, the vial, or your injection site.

Two: needles *are sharp*. That is a danger in and of itself, but also they *must* be sharp. A blunt needle is more dangerous than a sharp needle, just like a blunt kitchen knife is more dangerous than a sharp kitchen knife. First up, the general safety sharpness side of it:

- Again, keep a cap on the needle whenever possible so you don't spike yourself or something else, and again to prevent it contacting anything unsterile.

- When you recap the needle after using it, do NOT put the cap onto the needle with your hands, instead, place the cap on a desk, move your hands away from it, and slide the needle into the cap and kind of hook it up onto it, then you can press it onto the needle until it clicks into place. If that description is hard to follow, see the videos linked previously to see someone doing exactly this, or look at the pictures of me doing it. This method prevents the most likely point for you to accidentally stab your hand.

Now, the bluntness side of it: when a needle is sharp, it has a very clean sharp point that will cleanly pierce the skin, and can do so with the minimal possible damage. When a needle is used, that point experiences a very high pressure (because science!), and so it rolls over a little. It will end up forming a kind of hook shape that will certainly do more damage on both the way in and out as compared to a fresh needle. You cannot see this with the naked eye. You'll feel this as increased pain as you push into the skin and as increased soreness post injection. In addition, you should rotate (change between many) injection sites to allow them more time to heal and recover from the inevitable tissue damage that occurs due to an injection. The pictures below show a new and reused needle:

[add picture from exchange supplies]

Three: Keep Steady. You do not cause very much pain and damage by just inserting the needle into yourself. You are going to get more pain if you move the needle around while it's inside, both sideways, and especially in/out. Obviously you can only do so much, especially when you're nervous for your first injection and you're shaky, but as best as you can, try to push in in one motion, hold it as still as possible while you inject, then pull smoothly out.

## Miscellaneous Terminology

*Drawing* (or *drawing up*) is the process of pulling the injection from the vial into the syringe. A *drawing needle* is a needle that is being used purely to draw up.

Needle *Gauge* desrcibes the diameter of the needle. The *higher* the gauge number, the *thinner* the needle - yes, this is confusing! A 30G needle is thinner than a 20G needle.

*Dead Space* is the volume inside the needle that would retain the medication after the injection or removal of the needle. Needles generally come in either a standard kind which are just a plastic Luer connection bonded to a metal needle, or a *low dead space* variant in which the metal needle actually pokes through the syringe's hole back inside it to reduce the dead space.

*Luer Lock* and *Luer Slip* refer to standardised connection types for needles to syringes. Any Luer needle should work with any Luer syringe. Luer Slip needles just push (or slip!) onto the syringe and stay in place with friction. A Luer Lock needle on a Luer Lock syringe pushes in *and screws on clockwise* as you attach it, then will not come off without being unscrewed anticlockwise. **I strongly recommend you try to get Luer Lock needles and syringes!**

A *subcutaneous* or *subq* injection is one in which you inject into the layer of fat below the skin. These are generally done either on your tummy or thigh (I'll discuss how to find your site later). This guide covers subcutanous injections.

An *intramuscular* or *IM* injection is one in which you inject between two muscles, generally on your thighs for the case of HRT. This is done with a longer and thicker needle as it can reduce initial post-injection soreness, but requires a bigger needle, a less lenient injection site / more advanced technique, and you're more likely to see just a little blood.

*Air-Locking* is an injection technique in which you purposefully let a little air follow your HRT down to help prevent it from pushing up back out of your injection site or from being left in the needle. It is not something I do on purpose, and I don't recommend you do it in this guide, but it is a technique many people perform and is generally safe. If you get a small air bubble in your syringe that can actually be helpful for exactly this reason. This is safe for subcutaneous and intramuscular injections but ABSOLUTELY NOT for intravenous injections!

An *intravenous* injection is directly into the bloodstream. **It is not relevant for HRT.** Do not inject air intravenously under any circumstances, and you should aspirate.

*Aspiration* is an injection technique specific to intravenous injections (**NOT HRT!**) in which you pull back on the syringe after inserting it into yourself, to check if blood appears in the syringe. This is done to double check that you've successfully hit the vein. This technique is useless for HRT injections and you should not do it.

## Stuff You're Gonna Need

Obviously you're going to need your hormones/etc themselves first. For injection, these should come in a glass vial with a rubber stopper on the top. You should not attempt to open this vial in any way shape or form as this would not be sterile - you will literally poke holes in the top with a needle instead!

Next up, you're gonna need isopropyl alcohol swabs. The ones I'm using are 70% but it seems from a quick look like most of the swabs you could buy are the same. It's not too important as long as its quite high. You will need TWO of these per injection! One is for the vial and one is for the injection site.

Some people perform their injections with only needle, and I'll talk about doing that in the advice section later, but I recommend using two. For your injection needle, you want a length of between 1/2 inch and 5/8 inch for subq, and 1 to 1+1/2 inch for IM injections. You'll want a gauge of 25-30G for subq and 23-25G for IM.

For a drawing needle, that is the needle used to pull the hormones up into the syringe, kind of anything goes but a wider gauge is useful as it reduces resistance. I personally use 22-gauge needles that are 1+1/4 inch long to draw, because I can get these cheap in bulk.

I strongly recommend looking for *Luer Lock* needles, and buying those. Same for syringes. If you're worried about minimising wastage of your medication, it may be more economical to get all low dead space needles or even fixed-needle syringes (insulin syringes), depending on availability and the cost difference.

For a syringe, the main requirement is the capacity. You want a syringe that only has capacity of 1ml to help you get much greater accuracy (down to 0.01ml!) for the relatively small quantities at play with HRT injections. 3ml can work but you really want 1ml.

You will need a sharps box. You can get these in many places. This is to put your used needles in once you are done with them. *You cannot just put needles in the trash, they are considered a biohazard and must be stored in a sharps box and specially disposed of. Contact your local authority for information on how to dispose of medical waste where you are.* I like exchange supplies' compact locking one. You can also use a lidded hard plastic container, but its less ideal.

Finally, I recommend having a plaster/band-aid for after your injection. The ones I find the best are the small circular ones that are about 20-25mm diameter. This is because they stay on for much longer and are basically unnoticeable compared to larger more standard plasters. I have been getting them from plaster multipacks so far but you can also buy them online in bulk. My experience has been that pharmacies likely dont have boxes of JUST the small ones but naturally your mileage may vary.

If you are based in the UK as I am, then https://www.exchangesupplies.org/ is an awesome source for all of this stuff. I priced up all the supplies you'd need to get going at £40, but you can get it cheaper if you don't go standard for low dead space!

You can also ask a pharmacist for injection supplies in most places too, and you can also order them online - in the US even on Amazon!

Many needle brands will colour code their needles by gauge, which is helpful to help you remember which is for drawing and which is for injecting (e.g. my drawing needles are gray and my injecting needles are orange!)

## Injection Method

I suggest you read the method once through before starting so you know what's in store for you, but by all means feel free to follow it point-by-point as you go, its written with the intent of being read as you go.

So, you've got your medication, your syringe, your two needles, your two alcohol swabs, and your sharps bin out on your desk, a clear work space, and either are alone for privacy or have a trusted friend to help keep you calm (or even deliver the injection for you if you're too nervous and shaky! That's totally okay, especially if its your first time!). You know what your dose is. Let's do this.

<div class="imgcont">

  ![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_145552586.jpg)
</div>

### Prep: Drawing up

The first step I do is sterilising the vial because, to be totally honest, otherwise I might forget. So take one of your two alcohol swabs, and wipe it left to right across the top of the vial *once*. Do not wipe back and forth repeatedly like you might be accustomed to for cleaning, as then you'd be wiping any contaminants that you just picked up on the swab back over the rubber stopper again! One movement is enough. Place the swab and its packaging to the side (you'll likely end up with a little trash pile at the end of this, or you can throw stuff straight in the bin, whatever works for you).

Next we'll prep the drawing needle. Take your drawing needle and syringe out of the blister pack, and lock them together. Make sure you keep the needle's cap on. If you have a luer lock syringe, you need to twist on the needle until its secure. The cap and needle are designed such that twisting the cap will twist the needle, so you can and should do this with the cap on.

<div class="imgcont">

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_145745895.jpg)

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_145858168.jpg)
</div>

Now to draw up. Before we actually draw, we're gonna inject just a little bit of air into the vial to help reduce the pressure differential caused by removing some of the medication. Draw in maybe 0.3 to 0.4ml of air, and then slide the cap off the needle and place it on the desk with the opening facing you. Hold the vial steady, and holding the syringe like a dart, push the needle straight through the rubber.

<div class="imgcont">

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_150050896.jpg)

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_150126372.jpg)

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_150130081.jpg)
</div>

Inject the air *above* the medication, not into it, you don't really want to put air bubbles your medication, then pick up the vial and needle and invert it, so that the vial is above the needle, and make sure to rotate the syringe and push it in/out so that the needle is in the medication.

<div class="imgcont">

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_150150677.jpg)
</div>

Now, pull back on the syringe, and you'll see some air come in, then the medication will start to come into the syringe and sit at the bottom by the plunger. Pull back until you clearly have comfortably more there than your dosage (you need to have enough for your dosage plus the dead space!)

<div class="imgcont">

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_150205271.jpg)
</div>

then, push back up to where your dosage is.

<div class="imgcont">

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_150227733.jpg)
</div>

If you have more dead space in your drawing needle than your injecting needle, then once you have done this a few times, you'll get a feel for how much extra you get here and can compensate for that. For your first time or if you're not sure, just go to where your dosage is.

Now, this is where this guide diverges from the Plume guide. Push the syringe into the vial and get the end of the needle into the *air* space in the vial, and just pull some amount of this in, so your syringe looks pretty much the same as before you dialed the amount in, but now it contains exactly your dosage + the dead space.

<div class="imgcont">

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_150314735.jpg)
</div>

The reason to do this instead of just switching needles directly from the dialed in stage is that it makes it easier to get air bubbles out by allowing all the air to form together at the top, and makes learning the dead space delta between your two needles easier.

Now, you can flip the vial and syringe over, doing your best not to wiggle them around too much in relation to each other as this increases coring. Now, holding the vial still, pull the syringe smoothly up and out of it, then push the needle carefully into the cap and hook it upwards onto it, allowing you to click it down safely into place.

<div class="imgcont">

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_150348738.jpg)

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_150408671.jpg)

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_150412069.jpg)

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_150414295.jpg)
</div>

Congrats! You've drawn up. This is the longest stage of needle prep.

You can now put your medication vial away, and you'll be able to discard the drawing needle after the next step, switching the needles.

### Prep: The Injecting Needle

Take your injection needle out of its blister package, take off the drawing needle and discard it *into the sharps bin*, and put the injection needle onto the syringe.

<div class="imgcont">

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_150508505.jpg)

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_150552498.jpg)

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_150557617.jpg)
</div>

If you don't know what the difference is between a low dead space and standard needle, take a moment to notice in my pictures specifically the visual difference (the orange one is the low-dead-space). You can use a low dead space needle for one, the other, both, none, it does not matter, but you can see how they look and how they interface with the syringe here :)

Now, holding the syringe needle-side-up and securely at around the midpoint, flick the top side of the syringe or the needle cap to encourage any air bubbles that may be in the medication up and towards the top to merge with the air gap. You can do this with reasonable force!

<div class="imgcont">

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_150650733.jpg)
</div>

Now for the step where you get your dosage just perfect: push the syringe in until you hit the dosage you want on the syringe. You may lose some medication out of the end of the needle in this step. That's fine, that's the difference in dead space between the first and second needle, *after you've done this a few times and are comfortable with the process,* you can study when exactly that happens and account for it. And hey, it makes the needle look cool as hell with little drops clinging to it :p

<div class="imgcont">

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_150748587.jpg)
</div>

Note: You may see an air bubble push back into the syringe no matter how hard you try to keep it out. *This is okay, don't sweat it*, assuming its ~pretty small. I'm not going to cover airlocking here but a little bit of air actually doesn't hurt at all and *can* even be used to your advantage. The warnings you may hear about injecting air making you *die* refer to intravenous (into the bloodstream) injections, and are true, but not relevant here, so *don't sweat it*. You need to be as calm as you can manage for the injection! So being reassured about things that might *just happen* as you prep is good. The bubble pictured is totally chill:

<div class="imgcont">

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_150814450.jpg)
</div>

### Prep: The Injection Site

Now, you need to find your injection site. For intramuscular injections, which this guide is not about you should watch the Plume IM video linked above, as you really need to *watch someone do this* I think. For subcutaneous injections, your injection sites are the tummy and thighs. On your tummy, you go from your belly button down one inch and to the left/right one inch. On your thighs, you basically just want anywhere you can grab a good fold of fatty skin. I find that I just kinda go for a suitable spot on my thighs naturally, so see where on my thigh I'm doing it in these pictures:

<div class="imgcont">

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_151025015.jpg)

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_151028990.jpg)

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_151100531.jpg)

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_151107141.jpg)
</div>

You'll want to rotate sites each time - so if you did the left side last time do the right side this time, or perhaps rotate between tummy and thigh. *My personal recommendation is not to bother with the tummy, it's less lenient to find your spot, and it hurts and bleeds more if you mess up*.

Now, grab a fold of skin, like I have in the picture above. You want it to be as much as you can manage to grab really, it needs to be enough to put the needle into the site and it to stay entirely within the fold you have grabbed. Now, to give yourself a clear visual target, take the syringe and needle STILL IN ITS CAP and push it relatively hard into the fold of skin as shown in the picture. Yes, this step will hurt a bit, actually more than the injection itself, but the point here is to leave a nice clear circular mark so that you can see exactly where your injection site is. This is harmless as long as you don't go overboard!

<div class="imgcont">

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_151252738.jpg)

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_151255885.jpg)

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_151258784.jpg)
</div>

Now you can let go of the fold of skin and put your syringe down. Take the second alcohol swab out of its packet, and you want to do a single spiral motion outwards from the middle of the site. Watch the videos linked at the top of the page for a proper demo of this.

<div class="imgcont">
<video src="/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_151317424.LS.mp4" muted autoplay loop></video>
</div>

Finally, get a plaster ready to go. Take it out of its packaging, maybe peel back some of the backing paper and have it ready on the desk to put on after you've done your injection.

<div class="imgcont">

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_151405064.jpg)
</div>

Now your injection site is sterilised, take a deep breath, get yourself calm, put on piano music if you need to, because its time for the big moment.

### Injecting

*A quick note before I start this step*: I was a little silly and misread when I was buying needle supplies last, so my injection needles are about twice as long as I actually want for injecting. As a result of this, when you look at the pictures of me injecting here, you'll see about half the length of the needle still outside of the skin. **You should not copy that** assuming your needles are the size recommended in the "Stuff You're Gonna Need" section. Your needles should go all the way down to the skin as you inject, like you see in the Plume demonstration video linked at the top of the page.

Alright! You've got your fresh needle and syringe with the perfect amount of medication in it all prepped, you've found, marked, and sterilized your injection site, make sure you've calmed your nerves as much as possible (again, feel free to hand off this part of the guide to a trusted friend to deliver your injection if you are too nervous or otherwise shaky to bear to do this for yourself, especially if its your first time). It's time to inject.

Take the cap off your needle, and make sure that you put the syringe down so that the needle is in open air and not contacting anything that could contaminate it, then grab the fold of skin around your injection site (use two hands to make sure you've got it all if necessary), and make sure you're holding it nice and securely.

Before you pick up the syringe, just FYI, you're going to be injecting the needle at a 45 degree angle to the skin. If you're not sure what I mean exactly, look at this picture.

<div class="imgcont">

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_151543600.jpg)
</div>

Now, pick up the syringe between your index and middle finger, around halfway down or even nearer the needle end, whatever feels comfortable and secure, with the plunger on the inside of your hand, and rotate it such that the two finger brace points on the syringe will be above your index and middle fingers. Hold the syringe almost like a pen for stability.

<div class="imgcont">

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_151504309.jpg)
</div>

Brace your hand against your body for stability, and hold the needle above the center of the mark you made earlier, at a 45 degree angle to the skin. See the pictures below for reference.

Now, in as smooth of a single motion as you can manage, push the needle into your injection site and in a straight line into your body.

<div class="imgcont">

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_151551698.jpg)

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_151605605.jpg)
</div>

Trying to move the needle as little as possible, reposition your hand so that you have your index and middle fingers either side of the syringe and your thumb free, and slide your hand up the syringe so that your fingers are under the plastic braces and you can get your thumb over the plunger.

<div class="imgcont">

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_151605605.jpg)

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_151611102.jpg)
</div>

Gently press down on the plunger to push the medication into your body until it bottoms out.

<div class="imgcont">

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_151611102.jpg)

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_151619632.jpg)
</div>

Now, as smoothly as you can, slide the needle back out of you in a straight line just like it went in, and after this happens you can put it on the desk, let go of the skin fold, and put the plaster on (this is the most high-speed part of the process, the only reason for that being getting the plaster on nice and fast in case you bleed a little bit). It's not a big issue if you put the needle down on the desk uncapped as you do this as long as its not at risk of hurting anyone. It doesn't need to stay sterile anymore!

<div class="imgcont">

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_151622024.jpg)

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_151644974.jpg)
</div>

If you get a little bit of your medication that fires out the end of the needle as you release it from the skin, or some medication pushes back up out of the injection site, that's not the end of the world. It's not ideal and its what a small amount of air *can* help with if you're careful, but its not a biiiig deal either. Think of it as a similar kind of loss-in-the-process as dead space is. It is ideal for an injection to not bleed but one or two drops are totally fine, especially on the tummy! If you bleed more than that, its nonideal but not the end of the world, so get that plaster on to stop it from bleeding too much!

Now, you just need to tidy up. Safely pick the syringe up, and cap it just like you did the drawing needle: keep your hands away, push it into the cap, then rotate it up to hook the cap onto the needle, then push it on until it clicks. Then disconnect the needle and put it *in the sharps bin*.

<div class="imgcont">

![](/sink/quiet_injection/PXL_20250428_151708913.jpg)
</div>

Now, you can just throw away the packaging of the injection supplies, and you're done!

Well done! If that's new to you, as I assume it is given you're reading this, take a moment to be excited if you're excited, or take a moment to calm down if you're nervous and shaken. The nerves go away with time, and especially with repeated *successful* injections.

If you're starting HRT, congratulations on starting your HRT journey :)

And if you're switching to injections, congratulations on your first injection :)

## Post-Injection Routine

You can do what works for you, naturally, but I like to use the [MediTrak](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/projects.medicationtracker) app to track when I do my injections and remind me to do them, so my next step after putting my needles in the sharps bin is usually to mark the injection as complete in there.

Next, I like to keep an injection diary of sorts. I mark:

- the date,

- what I injected <u>where</u> (that's probably the most important part)

- how much of all supplies and medication I used up

- how much pain/soreness I experienced at the injection site during injection, immediately afterwards, and for how long after, and if it was only on movement or pressure or what

- how much blood came out after the injection

- whether or not medication pushed back out of the site and spurted out the needle (i find these tend to go together as both are a product of quantity of air in the syringe)

- any other notes about how the injection went that or what was special about this kind that i want to record.

Here's one of my shot diary entries for reference (I had just bought more plasters of a different brand to before for context):

```
2025-04-08
7mg 40mg/mL mct een subq thigh right
pain none. some E came back out, no blood.
used 1 25G, 1 22G, 2 alc swab, 1 small plaster, 1 syringe, 0.14ml een. ~1/2"
went smoothly. more resistance than usual plunging? I wish less came back up tho that's kinda annoying. 0.14 or so seems almost perfect for dead space! the Elastoplasts can be a pain to get on ugh they're ultra sticky but oh well
```

Sometimes I find that I do have to come back to this diary just to remember which site I'm meant to be using this time! So it can be worth keeping. Plus I find it nice to look back cause sometimes theres enough prompting there that I actually then remember the specific injection! Which is neat.

## General Injection Advice

- Don't sweat a small air bubble. You may have heard advice around injections talking about how dangerous injecting air is. It is true that you ideally want to not inject a lot of air into yourself, it'll cause bruising, but the warnings and horror stories you might read are specific to intravenous injections. For subcutaneous and intramuscular injections, its not really a big deal, though naturally don't go injecting a full 0.1ml of air into yourself just for shits and giggles, be sensible!

  - It is best if you can collect all the tiny bubbles that may be in the medication into a larger one, or the larger quantity of air at the top of the syringe while you're changing needles, as its nonideal to inject a bunch of tiny air bubbles alongside the medication. Quite often, air bubbles will just stick to the side of the syringe and wouldn't go into you anyway though.

  - There is a technique known as *airlocking* in which you purposefully allow a small amount of air to follow the medication down as you inject. Again this can increase bruising if you do too much, but it does flush out the dead space, and it helps keep the medication in, instead of pushing back up and out when you remove the needle.

  - I do not purposefully airlock (though again, I'm not concerned about injecting a small air bubble after my medication is in either!) but you can try it out once you've gotten used to doing injections, and see if it works for you.

- Don't worry about if you have body hair on the injection site, it does not affect the injection really, its just gonna mean that taking the bandaid off before it naturally loses its stick will hurt a bit more. The pictures of the injection process shown here are taken with the site shaved just to aid visual clarity.

- You can use a single needle for both drawing and injection if you are tight on funds for supplies. This also means you lose less medication to dead space. Please be aware that this will mean a slightly sharper pain on piercing the skin and an increased level of bruising due to the needle blunting a little during drawing. If you choose to do this, I would adapt my method as follows:

  - Instead of pulling excess air into the syringe, instead flick out all the air to the top and then push it into the vial such that you get exactly your dosage in that one step.

  - Then, you can pull the needle out of the vial, cap it, prep your injection site, and just inject with that

  - If you do this, you can also use fixed-needle syringes which allow you to get near-zero deadspace (less than a tenth of the dead space of a standard needle or about a quarter of that of a low-dead-space needle).

  - Fixed needle syringes are sometimes available with colour coding which may be helpful if you share your medication with a housemate and keep them together, but have different gauge/length preferences for your injections.

- Do your damn blood tests. This is kind of straying outside of the realm of pure injection advice here, but it is worth saying: you should be getting (for HRT) your E2 and T levels checked: before you start HRT if you haven't yet started, and three months after any change to your regimen (different ester, different dosage, different medium, etc.) Once you're on HRT, do your blood tests at the end of your cycle, when the levels are lowest (so, either on the day of or the day before your injection). If your levels are well within range and you're just doing the same thing as before, you can probably just leave it, but if you do any changes you should absolutely do a blood test after 3 months settling time.

- It's okay to be nervous, it's okay to be shaky. This is natural for giving yourself an injection at the start, and it is natural if you are the same after one that doesn't go quite as you planned. Try your best to be steady, as it will reduce bruising, and prioritise being safe, but you don't have to be dead still and zen. If you are struggling, and you have a friend, family member, or otherwise who you trust and are comfortable with helping, ask them to help you. You could:

  - Have a friend calm you down and comfort you

  - Have a friend actually deliver your injection, if you are not steady enough to do it yourself safely

  - Play calming music if that helps you

  - Prep the syringe for injection, go off and do something else for a few minutes (make a cup of tea perhaps!) to let your brain come down from the suspense of prepping the injection, then come back, prep your site, and deliver the injection.

  - If you're nervous about having a sharp needle in clone vicinity of your body, try sitting still with the needle in the general vicinity of your site, but not actually inserted into the site, until you start to acclimatise to and calm down to the situation of having a sharp needle near your body.

    - Be careful not to overdo this one if you're not quite so nervous to start with, as the more briskly you get in there, do it, and get out, the less time you have to get nervy about it.
